# Visualization

We created [several Tableau worksheets](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lukas.hoffmann#!/vizhome/aclu-bail-reform/ofseveritypercounty) (scroll down to "Metadata") and wrote an [ACLU bail reform report](https://github.com/lahoffm/aclu-bail-reform/blob/master/docs/ACLU%20bail%20reform%20report.pdf) in Jan 2018.

`dollars_saved_calculations.py`, uses numbers we got from Tableau. It computes rough estimates of dollars that would have been saved in Georgia in 2017 if misdemeanors were released within 48 hours after booking.

There is also a demo visualization in Jupyter notebook (Python 3.6.3) for Fulton county data.
Demo requires installation of `seaborn`, `pandas`, `numpy`.
